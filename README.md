# Todo-List
Here is a todo list with an edit and delete button. It's a simple Todo list anyone can think of. I actually made it simple and it is build using pure vanilla JavaScript. This project made me to know that coding requires consistency, cause i have actually forgotten some of the JavaScript and had to search about them using google. Hope you guys will love this design. I'm not good at CSS though.
